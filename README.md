# U.S. States Game
An educational game where the player aims to name all 50 U.S. States

## Gameplay
- Run the `main.py` file to play the game
- Every time the user types in a correct U.S. State, that state will be labeled on the map
- View the score in the title of the pop-up text box
- The game ends when the user has correctly guessed all 50 states or if the user types "exit"
- If the game exits early, a list of all the states the user missed will be generated in a csv file

## Additional Notes
- This project demonstrates the use of the `pandas` module and interacts with csv files
- Also incorporates the concept of list comprehension
